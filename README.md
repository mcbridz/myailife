# myailife
Development Repo for MyAILife, a personal blog webiste.


## Design Criteria
This webpage design is intended to be a single-page application for both owner and guests, with automation for emailing registered users with notifications of blog updates at the owner's discretion.

## Exploration Concepts
I am using this project as a means to explore front-end development without major css frameworks, as I've used on my previous projects, once I finish the back-end.
